/**
 * Created by Ruiqi Li on 2017/12/10.
 *
 *This is a customised view aiming to draw every elements on the screen for the game Snake.
 *Player can control the direction of this virtual snake (green bar in the pictures) by just tapping on the screen. When the snake eat
 *(touch) the food (green stroke square), it will become longer and keep moving. The food will disappear after eaten by the snake and
 *appear randomly around the screen immediately. The speed is increased every successful eaten and the lose condition is touching the wall
 *or "eat" (touch) snake itself. In the whole game mode, once the player have eaten 4 consecutive foods, the exit door (white stroke square)
 *will apear on the center of the screen and the player can leave and enter the next mini game.
